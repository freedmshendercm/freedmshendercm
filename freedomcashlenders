To gauge public opinion on various reforms, including the proposed rule, Pew surveyed 1,205 American adults and found:

70 percent of respondents want more regulation of payday loans.
7 in 10 adults want banks to offer small loans to consumers with low credit scores, and the same proportion would view a bank more favorably if it offered a $400, three-month loan for a $60 fee (as reportedly planned).
When evaluating a loan regulation’s effectiveness, Americans focus on pricing rather than origination processes.
Respondents say typical prices for payday installment loans that would probably be issued under the proposed rule are unfair.
80 percent dislike the proposal’s likely outcome of 400 percent APR payday installment loans with more time to repay, but 86 percent say enabling banks and credit unions to offer lower-cost loans would be a success.
